You can use the following hot-keys in Visual Studio Code for building and running your code:

Build:

Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to trigger the default build task.
Run (if you have a launch configuration):

Press `F5` to start debugging (runs your program with the debugger).
Press `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging.
Build & Run (combined):

There is no single default hot-key for "build and run" together, but you can set up a custom task or use extensions to combine these actions.
Tip: You can customize or view all hot-keys by pressing `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` in VS Code.
